LoveSpeech 1.0

This is the source code of ​​my app <LoveSpeech>. I had the idea around 2006, but was prevented from implementing it. Now, here it is.

Private Encryption for Social Media. Disguise your posts, only your friends can read.

With this app you encrypt your shitposts, which are secured with a password, disguised as foreign symbolism and decorated with emojis to make it look funnier. Only friends will be able to read your messages. For everyone else it will remain a mysterious wonder.

There are 25 amazing app themes for every user.

Choose from different styles such as Russian, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Hieroglyph, Braille of the Blind, Sumerian, Feng Shui and African Bamum Symbols.

You can export or import buddy lists. You export your buddy list, encrypt it and post it somewhere on the Internet. This way others can import them and use your passwords to read your messages and possibly those of your friends too. All you need is LoveSpeech!

Emojis can be turned on or off at will, depending on the mood.


The Algorithm

An additional public key is generated for each encryption to ensure uniqueness.

Both are combined, chopped up and mysteriously extended to 256 bytes. A list of 256 password runners is then generated and the password is self-modified thousands of times,
just to initialize it. The actual password runner behaves chaotically.

All processes in the algorithm are controlled only by the password, which is self-modified hundreds of times with each access. At the same time, it is ensured that the chaotic password runner is replaced every now and then in order to flip the algorithm in an unpredictable way. 

The entire text is encrypted hundreds of times depending on its length, but at least 3x.

Every single text character is encrypted hundreds of times, but at least 32 times.

The resulting cipher code is now moved in the Unicode area so that the desired symbols can be seen. The decryption process is reversed. Only one routine is needed for encryption and decryption.

The cipher code is structured in 3 lines, so that the encrypted message follows first, then the user name and then the public key. There can be lines with other things above and below. When decrypting, a line is first searched for that has a known user name and then the password is taken and the cipher is decrypted.

GOALS:

If everyone uses private encryption for social media, the Internet will become a strange mystery to everyone.

When no one can read what others have written on the Internet, free speech will apply everywhere.

You can write about anything you think in public and only selected friends can read it.
